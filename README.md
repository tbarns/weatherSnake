# Weather App 2.0: A Reinvention

## **Introduction**

Back in the days when I was just dipping my toes into the vast ocean of coding, I embarked on a journey to create a weather application. It was a straightforward application utilizing the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to provide users with a 5-day forecast, extracting the latitude and longitude for each location to detail humidity, wind speed, and representative weather icons.

However, my initial attempt had some areas of improvement. Notably, the exposure of my API key in my frontend code. With gained knowledge and experience, I aimed to rectify this and take on an even bigger challenge.

## **The Reinvention**

Instead of merely securing the API key, I dared myself to eliminate JavaScript completely and implement this application in a whole new language.

### **Why Remove JavaScript?**

JavaScript, while undeniably powerful and pervasive, can sometimes be sidelined for server-side solutions that offer enhanced security. This shift from client-side to server-side ensured my API key was safely stowed away.

### **Embracing Python with Flask**

Transitioning from JavaScript led me to the embrace of Python, a language renowned for its versatility. Paired with Flask, a micro web framework, it seemed the ideal choice for this venture. With Flask at the helm, the new Weather App manages search history and securely communicates with the OpenWeatherMap API. All of this, without a single line of JavaScript.

### **Tech Stack & Tools**
- **Python & Flask:** Backend scripting and web framework.
- **Jinja2:** Flask's templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.
- **dotenv:** Secure management of environment variables.
- **requests:** A Python module essential for API interactions.
- **Flask-CORS:** Handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## **Passion for Discovery**

This project signifies more than just a technical journey. It stands as a testament to my insatiable passion for discovery and knowledge. It allowed me to delve into new realms, all the while rectifying past oversights.
